1. **Xbox Game Prediction**

      **Project idea**: The data generated by people while searching can be used to predict the interest of the users. The BestBuy consumer electronics company has provided the data of millions of searches from users and we will predict the Xbox game that a user will be most interested to buy. This will be used to recommend games to the visitors. <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/acm-sf-chapter-hackathon-small/overview">Dataset:</a>
